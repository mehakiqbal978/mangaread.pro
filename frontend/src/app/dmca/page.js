          <h2>Data Ownership and Aggregation</h2>
          <p>
            mangaread.pro is an automated metadata aggregator. The platform was built by a fan of the medium to provide a clean, ad-free interface for reading content that is already publicly distributed across the internet. 
          </p>

            mangaread.pro respects the intellectual property rights of others and complies with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA).
